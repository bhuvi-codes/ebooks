			"There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long in the streets with little idle boys like himself. This so grieved the father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother's tears and prayers, Aladdin did not mend his ways. One day, when he was playing in the streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he was not the son of Mustapha the tailor. \"I am, sir,\" replied Aladdin; \"but he died a long while ago.\" On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on his neck and kissed him saying: \"I am your uncle, and knew you from your likeness to my brother. Go to your mother and tell her I am coming.\" Aladdin ran home and told his mother of his newly found uncle. \"Indeed, child,\" she said, \"your father had a brother, but I always thought he was dead.\" However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle, who came laden with wine and fruit. He fell down and kissed the place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin's mother not to be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty years out of the country. He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst into tears. On learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade, he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise. Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes and took him all over the city, showing him the sights, and brought him home at nightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine.",
			"Next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long way outside the city gates. They sat down by a fountain and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided between them. Then they journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains. Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories and lead him on in spite of himself. At last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley. \"We will go no farther,\" said his uncle. \"I will show you something wonderful; only do you gather up sticks while I kindle a fire.\" When it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him, at the same time saying some magical words. The earth trembled a little in front of them, disclosing a square flat stone with a brass ring in the middle to raise it by. Aladdin tried to run away, but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down. \"What have I done, uncle?\" he said piteously; whereupon the magician said more kindly: \"Fear nothing, but obey me. Beneath this stone lies a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may touch it, so you must do exactly as I tell you.\" At the word treasure Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ring as he was told, saying the names of his father and grandfather. The stone came up quite easily, and some steps appeared. \"Go down,\" said the magician; \"at the foot of those steps you will find an open door leading into three large halls. Tuck up your gown and go through them without touching anything, or you will die instantly. These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees. Walk on till you come to niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp. Pour out the oil it contains, and bring it me.\" He drew a ring from his finger and gave it to Aladdin, bidding him prosper.",
			"Aladdin found everything as the magician had said, gathered some fruit off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth of the cave. The magician cried out in a great hurry: \"Make haste and give me the lamp.\" This Aladdin refused to do until he was out of the cave. The magician flew into a terrible passion, and throwing some more powder on to the fire, he said something, and the stone rolled back into its place. The man left the country, which plainly showed that he was no uncle of Aladdin's but a cunning magician, who had read in his magic books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most powerful man in the world. Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only receive it from the hand of another. He had picked out the foolish Aladdin for this purpose, intending to get the lamp and kill him afterwards."

			"Once upon a time . . . a very poor woodcutter lived in a tiny cottage in the forest with his two children, Hansel and Gretel. His second wife often ill-treated the children and was forever nagging the woodcutter. \"There is not enough food in the house for us all. There are too many mouths to feed! We must get rid of the two brats,\" she declared. And she kept on trying to persuade her husband to abandon his children in the forest. \"Take them miles from home, so far that they can never find their way back! Maybe someone will find them and give them a home.\" The downcast woodcutter didn't know what to do. Hansel who, one evening, had overheard his parents' conversation, comforted Gretel. =--= \"Don't worry! If they do leave us in the forest, we'll find the way home,\" he said. And slipping out of the house he filled his pockets with little white pebbles, then went back to bed. All night long, the woodcutter's wife harped on and on at her husband till, at dawn, he led Hansel and Gretel away into the forest. But as they went into the depths of the trees, Hansel dropped a little white pebble here and there on the mossy green ground. At a certain point, the two children found they really were alone: the woodcutter had plucked up enough courage to desert them, had mumbled an excuse and was gone. Night fell but the woodcutter did not return. Gretel began to sob bitterly. Hansel too felt scared but he tried to hide his feelings and comfort his sister.",
			"\"Don't cry, trust me! I swear I'll take you home even if Father doesn t come back for us!\" Luckily the moon was full that night and Hansel waited till its cold light filtered through the trees. \"Now give me your hand!\" he said. \"We'll get home safely, you'll see!\" The tiny white pebbles gleamed in the moonlight, and the children found their way home. They crept through a half-open window, without wakening their parents. Cold, tired but thankful to be home again, they slipped into bed. Next day, when their stepmother discovered that Hansel and Gretel had returned, she went into a rage. Stifling her anger in front of the children, she locked her bedroom door, reproachlng her husband for failing to carry out her orders. The weak woodcutter protested, torn as he was between shame and fear of disobeying his cruel wife. The wicked stepmother kept Hansel and Gretel under lock and key all day with nothing for supper but a sip of water and some hard bread. All night, husband and wife quarrelled, and when dawn came, the woodcutter led the children out into the forest. Hansel, however, had not eaten his bread, and as he walked through the trees, he left a trail of crumbs behind him to mark the way. But the little boy had forgotten about the hungry birds that lived in the forest. When they saw him, they flew along behind and in no time at all, had eaten all the crumbs. Again, with a lame excuse, the woodcutter left his two children by themselves. \"I've left a trail, like last time!\" Hansel whispered to Gretel, consolingly. But when night fell, they saw to their horror, that all the crumbs had gone.",
			"\"I'm frightened!\" wept Gretel bitterly. \"I'm cold and hungry and I want to go home!\" \"Don't be afraid. I'm here to look after you!\" Hansel tried to encourage his sister, but he too shivered when he glimpsed frightening shadows and evil eyes around them in the darkness. All night the two children huddled together for warmth at the foot of a large tree. When dawn broke, they started to wander about the forest, seeking a path, but all hope soon faded. They were well and truly lost. On they walked and walked, till suddenly they came upon a strange cottaae in the middle of a glade. \"This is chocolate!\" gasped Hansel as he broke a lump of plaster from the wall. \"And this is icing!\" exclaimed Gretel, putting another piece of wall in her mouth. Starving but delighted, the children began to eat pieces of candy broken off the cottage. \"Isn't this delicious?\" said Gretel, with her mouth full. She had never tasted anything so nice. \"We'll stay here,\" Hansel declared, munching a bit of nougat. They were just about to try a piece of the biscuit door when it quietly swung open. \"Well, well!\" said an old woman, peering out with a crafty look. \"And haven't you children a sweet tooth?\" \"Come in! Come in, you've nothing to fear!\" went on the old woman. Unluckily for Hansel and Gretel, however, the sugar candy cottage belonged to an old witch, her trap for catching unwary victims. The two children had come to a really nasty place . . . \"You're nothing but skin and bones!\" said the witch, locking Hansel into a cage. I shall fatten you up and eat you!\" \"You can do the housework,\" she told Gretel grimly, \"then I'll make a meal of you too!\" As luck would have it, the witch had very bad eyesight, an when Gretel smeared butter on her glasses, she could see even less. \"Let me feel your finger!\" said the witch to Hansel every day to check if he was getting any fatter. Now, Gretel had brought her brother a chicken bone, and when the witch went to touch his finger, Hansel held out the bone. \"You're still much too thin!\" she complained. When will you become plump?\" One day the witch grew tired of waltlng."
